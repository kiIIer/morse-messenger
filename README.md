# morse-messenger

## Spec

The idea is to create a messenger which will allow users to communicate much like people used to with morse code. You have radio frequences, you can transmit signals through it and they will be in morse code. You press button and everyone on this frequency will hear you. 

Clients will have terminal user interface where they will see signal, selected frequency and the ability to change it.

For new users the default morse encoder and decoder will be provided.

The messenger will use gRPC for communication between clients and server
